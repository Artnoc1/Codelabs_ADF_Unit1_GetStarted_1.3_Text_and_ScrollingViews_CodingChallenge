# Coding Challenge - Android fundamentals 01.3: Text and scrolling views
![](text_scrollview_challenge_github.gif)
## Challenge :

Add another UI element—a Button—to the LinearLayout inside the ScrollView so that it scrolls with the text.

* Make the Button appear below the article. The user scrolls to the end of the article to see the Button.
* Use the text Add Comment for the Button. For this challenge, there is no need to create a button-handling method; all you have to do is put the Button element in the proper place in the layout.
